## Aim
To understand and implement `if` statements and `switch` statements in C++.

## Software Used
- VS Code

## Problem Statements

1. **Grade Evaluator**
   - Write a C++ program to evaluate and display grades based on user input.

2. **Leap Year Checker**
   - Write a C++ program to determine if a given year is a leap year.

3. **Password Validator**
   - Write a C++ program to validate a userâ€™s password based on specified criteria.

4. **Simple Calculator**
   - Write a C++ program to create a basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations.
   - 
5. **Days of the Week**
   - Write a C++ program to print the days of the week based on user input.

## Theory

- **`if` Statement**: Used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.
- **`else` Statement**: Executes a block of code if the condition in the `if` statement is false.
- **`else if` Statement**: Tests a new condition if the previous `if` condition is false.
- **`switch` Statement**: Allows the execution of different blocks of code based on the value of an expression. It can have multiple `case` labels for different values and only supports `int` or `char` types for the expression.
